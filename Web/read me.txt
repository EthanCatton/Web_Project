This is my web project

run it with the run.ps1 file after running the install_requirements.ps1 file.

Docker and npm/node.js need to be installed separately first.
Due to VM issues I couldn't properly test the install from a clean start so there may be minor packages missing! 

This is the first version of this project, I finished it a few months ago and returned today to make it more user friendly before it goes on github. 

The database has been wiped a couple times so the actual saved database is quite small, the spider starts from movie Wikipedia so that is all of the results
from the get go. 

Plans for version 2:

-Actual usage of the benefits of Docker (right now all containers are 1-1-1 etc, with some changes there could be multiple spiders and processors, the framework is there
but not implemented yet).
-better ui 
-images
